ReactR bot is a simple bot which searches for keywords in messages, and reacts to messages containing keywords. The prefix for the bot is `,` and is configurable by with the `settings prefix` command. All commands *except* `,list` require either the Administrator permission, or being in a role that is in the bot's admin list. Roles are added as a bot admin with `,addrole @role`. See the help for more information.
